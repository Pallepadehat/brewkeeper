# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in brewkeeper, please report it
responsibly.

**Do not open a public issue.** Instead, email the maintainer directly or use
GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature:

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/Pallepadehat/brewkeeper/security)
2. Click **Report a vulnerability**
3. Provide a clear description, reproduction steps, and any relevant context

You should receive an acknowledgment within 48 hours. We will work with you to
understand and address the issue before any public disclosure.

## Scope

This policy covers the `brewkeeper` CLI tool and its build/release
infrastructure. Issues in upstream dependencies (Bun, Homebrew, OpenTUI) should
be reported to their respective maintainers.
